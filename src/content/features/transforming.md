The University of Michigan Press is uniquely poised to help scholars bring multimedia scholarship to the academic community and the public thanks to our [open source digital publishing platform, Fulcrum](fulcrum.org). In addition to hosting our ebook collection and open access titles, Fulcrum allows us to partner with authors to redefine the traditional monograph and expand published scholarship beyond the book. 

The titles below are divided into two categories [introduced by Michael Elliott in his germinal paper, published in the *Journal of Electronic Publishing*](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jep/3336451.0018.407/--future-of-the-monograph-in-the-digital-era-a-report?rgn%3Dmain;view%3Dfulltext;q1%3Delliott&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1626451848783000&usg=AOvVaw1hDky0ia1rMWWIVOfz2Bom), on the future of the digital monograph. The main distinction is between enhanced ebooks and interactive scholarly works.
