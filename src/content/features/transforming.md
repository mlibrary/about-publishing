        book: Music on the Move
        quote:
          quote: "The opportunity to publish with the University of Michigan Press has
            allowed me to think as I'm writing about what music I want my reader
            to hear, and then embed it in the enhanced ebook on Fulcrum. "

            title: Rich Media Integration
            text: The ability to embed media enables authors to tell their stories in a more
              natural way, allowing readers to experience the media in real-time
              (versus reading a description of it). Enhanced ebooks on Fulcrum
              include integrated media such as audio, video, images, maps, and
              3D models.

              while simultaneously reading the text in the Fulcrum ereader. "

            title: Interactive Maps
            text: "Music on the Move also includes interactive maps, linked both within the
              text and on the resources tab on the main book page, where readers
              can explore the metadata associated with an individual media
              object. "
      - type: highlight
        text: Rather than forcing authors to strip away the richness of the digital
          materials at the point of formal publication to meet the constraints
          of a book format, Fulcrum facilitates rich integration of such digital
          objects with the narratives that reference them. **Learn more by

            audiobooks. I had long been interested in applying audiovisual tools
            to the analysis of audiovisual culture, but it was only when I began
            working with the Press that I felt the confidence to undertake such
            a project.

The University of Michigan Press is uniquely positioned to help scholars bring multimedia scholarship to both the academic community and the public thanks to our [open source digital publishing platform, Fulcrum](fulcrum.org). In addition to hosting our ebook collection and open access titles, Fulcrum allows us to partner with authors to redefine the traditional monograph and expand published scholarship beyond the book. 

Performing Arts and Media Studies, two key subject areas for the Press, have increasingly been taking advantage of the The titles below are divided into two categories [introduced by Michael Elliott in his germinal paper, published in the *Journal of Electronic Publishing*](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jep/3336451.0018.407/--future-of-the-monograph-in-the-digital-era-a-report?rgn%3Dmain;view%3Dfulltext;q1%3Delliott&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1626451848783000&usg=AOvVaw1hDky0ia1rMWWIVOfz2Bom), on the future of the digital monograph. The main distinction is between enhanced ebooks and interactive scholarly works.
