Debate and Democracy is an interdisciplinary collection of 25 books that explore the core tensions in American political culture—tensions that erupt every four years during the presidential election. In 2020, the very fate of the Union appears to be at stake. Rather than a formal political secession, as in the election of 1860, the 2020 presidential election has thrown a spotlight on a people violently divided by wealth, values, identity, and competing visions of the America they want to leave their children. For many, the election seems to be a referendum not only on the nation’s future, but a personal judgment on themselves as people deserving of citizenship. Historically, the United States has walked a tightrope between narratives of liberty and legal restriction. The founders restricted voting to free, mostly white men who owned property. Gradually, the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments to the Constitution and the Civil Rights bills of the 1960s legally opened the franchise to all Americans regardless of race, class, or gender. Yet the reality is more complicated. In 2020, poor people, people of color, immigrants, and others who seem to live on the margins of American middle-class life struggle to participate in American democracy.

Intended as a companion to the University of Michigan Fall 2020 theme semester, Debate and Democracy, the Press’s 2020 presidential election reading list offers an opportunity for students to experience the richest, most comprehensive scholarship available today. Readers will find books that contextualize their own experiences of voting in America, perhaps, as well as big picture analyses of leadership, activism, and international pressures, as well as critiques of the democratic processes that control who gets to sit in the chair, and who gets to pull the lever.
