          Through the Humanities Open Book Program, the University of Michigan
          has made 100 significant books about Asia published by the Centers
          within the U-M International Institute that focus on South, Southeast,
          and East Asia freely available online.  These titles constitute just
          one-third of the publishing output of these Centers over the last 50
          years, and we continue to work to make sure all the books are back in
          print and also converted, where possible, into ebook form.

          The Michigan Asian Studies Open Access Books Collection grew from a
          partnership between faculty from four Asian Studies Centers at the
          University of Michigan, librarians from U-M Asia Library and
          International Studies, and University of Michigan Press staff. It was
          made possible through a generous grant from the National Endowment for
          the Humanities,. It is one of many collections of open access books
          that have been made possible by the Humanities Open Book Program that
          NEH and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation created.


          The titles in the Michigan Asian Studies Open Access Books Collection are presented in discoverable, accessible, and citable form. The books are free to read on Michigan's Fulcrum platform at each Center’s page and within the University of Michigan Press Ebook Collection (UMP EBC).

        text: The University of Michigan Press is increasingly strong in international
          relations and area studies, with a particular focus on East and
          Southeast Asia. The 2021 list aims to shift perspectives and challenge
          and re-envision our understanding of Asian Studies. Highlights include
          Liang Luo's Global White Snake and three volumes of world-renowned
          playwright Stan Lai's Selected Plays.

**Register for the Open Access Publishing in Asian Studies event and learn more about the rich tradition of Asian Studies scholarship and publishing at the University of Michigan.**

—

Open Access publishing means that ebooks can be read by anybody in the world with access to an internet connection. Because open access titles are openly-licensed and downloadable as well as free-to-read online, they are now available for integration into digital scholarship projects. As book publishing moves increasingly digital, the collaboration between the University of Michigan Press, International Institute, and U-M Asia Library offers new opportunities for imaginative publishing that transcends disciplinary boundaries, reaches readers outside as well as inside the academy, and extends the understanding of Asian culture, history, and society around the world.

The Open Access Publishing in Asian Studies event highlights the impact of the [Michigan Asian Studies Open Access Books Collection](https://www.publishing.umich.edu/features/asian-studies). While the event focuses on University of Michigan publications, the panels aim to explore opportunities for open access publishing in Asian studies more broadly. **[View the event program here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PcYRpAY1f8hMkHe1eNLa-1z611QUvz_1PvaanWWQ85E/edit?usp=sharing).**
