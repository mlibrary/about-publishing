          Through the Humanities Open Book Program, the University of Michigan
          has made 100 significant books about Asia published by the Centers
          within the U-M International Institute that focus on South, Southeast,
          and East Asia freely available online.  These titles constitute just
          one-third of the publishing output of these Centers over the last 50
          years, and we continue to work to make sure all the books are back in
          print and also converted, where possible, into ebook form.

          The Michigan Asian Studies Open Access Books Collection grew from a
          partnership between faculty from four Asian Studies Centers at the
          University of Michigan, librarians from U-M Asia Library and
          International Studies, and University of Michigan Press staff. It was
          made possible through a generous grant from the National Endowment for
          the Humanities,. It is one of many collections of open access books
          that have been made possible by the Humanities Open Book Program that
          NEH and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation created.


          The titles in the Michigan Asian Studies Open Access Books Collection are presented in discoverable, accessible, and citable form. The books are free to read on Michigan's Fulcrum platform at each Center’s page and within the University of Michigan Press Ebook Collection (UMP EBC).

        text: The University of Michigan Press is increasingly strong in international
          relations and area studies, with a particular focus on East and
          Southeast Asia. The 2021 list aims to shift perspectives and challenge
          and re-envision our understanding of Asian Studies. Highlights include
          Liang Luo's Global White Snake and three volumes of world-renowned
          playwright Stan Lai's Selected Plays.
