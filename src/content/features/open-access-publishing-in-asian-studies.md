          Through the Humanities Open Book Program, the University of Michigan
          has made 100 significant books about Asia published by the Centers
          within the U-M International Institute that focus on South, Southeast,
          and East Asia freely available online.  These titles constitute just
          one-third of the publishing output of these Centers over the last 50
          years, and we continue to work to make sure all the books are back in
          print and also converted, where possible, into ebook form.

          relations and area studies, with a particular focus on East and

          and re-envision our understanding of Asian Studies. Highlights include
          Liang Luo's Global White Snake and three volumes of world-renowned
