          of Michigan Press*


          This event highlights the impact of the [Michigan Asian Studies Open Access Books Collection](https://www.publishing.umich.edu/features/asian-studies) so far, and asks “where do we go from here?” While it is focused on the Michigan publications as a case study, the panel aims to explore more broadly the opportunities for Open Access publishing in Asian studies more generally. **The full program for the event is available [here](https://publishing.umich.edu/assets/eventprogram.pdf).**


          Thank you to the directors of the participating centers (CJS, CSAS, CSEAS, LRCCS, NCKS) and Asia Library: The Center for Japanese Studies: Reginald Jackson; The Lieberthal-Rogel Center for Chinese Studies: Twila Tardif; The Center for South Asian Studies: Jatin Dua; The Center for Southeast Asian Studies: Laura Rozek; The Nam Center for Korean Studies: Nojin Kwak; The Asia Library: Dawn Lawson.

          Through the Humanities Open Book Program, the University of Michigan
          Press has made 100 significant books about Asia freely and publicly
          available online, in editions that enrich the reading and teaching
          experience through digital enhancements. These titles advance public
          understanding of the diversity of society, culture, and history in
          East, South, and Southeast Asia at a time when the region is rarely
          out of the headlines.

          The Michigan Asian Studies Open Access Books Collection grew from a
          partnership between faculty from four Asian Studies Centers at the
          University of Michigan, librarians from U-M Asia Library and
          International Studies, and University of Michigan Press staff.


          The titles in the Michigan Asian Studies Open Access Books Collection are presented in discoverable, accessible, and citable form. The books are free to read on Fulcrum at each Center’s page and within the University of Michigan Press Ebook Collection (UMP EBC).

          relations and area studies, with a particular focus on East and
          Southeast Asia. The 2021 list aims to shift perspectives and challenge
          and re-envision our understanding of Asian Studies. Highlights include
          Liang Luo's Global White Snake and three volumes of world-renowned
          playwright Stan Lai's Selected Plays.

Open Access publishing means that ebooks can be read by anybody in the world with access to an internet connection. Because open access titles are openly-licensed and downloadable as well as free-to-read online, they are now also available for integration into digital scholarship projects. As book publishing moves increasingly digital, an International Institute collaboration with the U-M Press and with the Asia Library offers new opportunities for imaginative publishing that transcends disciplinary boundaries, reaches readers outside as well as inside the academy, and extends the understanding of Asian culture, history, and society around the world.

Over the last 50 years, the centers now housed in the University of Michigan International Institute have published over 300 ground-breaking books about East, South, and Southeast Asia. In 2018, these centers collaborated with University of Michigan Press and the U-M Asia Library to successfully apply for a [Humanities Open Book program grant](https://www.neh.gov/project/michigan-asian-studies-open-access-books-collection) from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, aimed at making important backlist books broadly available again. This funding has allowed a complete record of the centers’ publications to be compiled and for 100 selected titles to be brought back into print and made digitally-available open access. These are now all freely available on major online platforms including JSTOR, Project MUSE, OAPEN, and as part of the University of Michigan Press Ebook Collection.
