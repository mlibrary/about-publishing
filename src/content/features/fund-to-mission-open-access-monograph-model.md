          we strive to deliver the best scholarship to the broadest possible
          audience. The Press has published close to 300 open access titles to
          date. These titles are available to freely read and download on the
          Fulcrum platform. MARC records for open access books are freely
          available to download to your library catalog, and we encourage you to
          do so here: https://ftp.fulcrum.org/UMPEBC/MARC/. "

Working with LYRASIS, the University of Michigan Press has been taking steps to develop a publishing program that aligns with our mission and commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. Since spring 2021, the Press has been transitioning to an open access monograph model termed Fund to Mission.

Fund to Mission demonstrates a return to [the origins of the university press movement](https://charleston-hub.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9c7b74f7c0dd90bee932a6473&id=fbe996f833&e=0570623b50) and moves toward a more open, sustainable infrastructure for the humanities and social sciences. Our goal is to convert at least 75% of U-M Press monographs to open access by the end of 2023, **without any author ever having to pay**.
