          **The Funding Model**


          The Press is seeking a total of $250,000 in annual funding from the library community as it transitions to open. After extensive consultation with libraries, we have adopted a simple approach to reach our annual funding goal. By committing to purchase one of the UMP EBC packages, libraries:


          * Support the conversion to open access of at least half (~45) of University of Michigan Press scholarly monographs in 2022. (We will expand this percentage if we realize our full goal, and will build on it in succeeding years);

          * Receive perpetual access to the remaining restricted frontlist titles and term access to the backlist (~1,500 titles), which will otherwise remain closed to non-purchasers;

          * Support authors’ ability to publish innovative, digital scholarship leveraging the next-generation, open-source [Fulcrum platform](fulcrum.org).

          **The Mission**


          With Fund to Mission, we are asking for shared investment in strengthening humanities and social sciences infrastructure and scholarship. Through a transparent model that fits with existing library workflows and provides unique benefits to supporters, we hope to:


          * Expand inclusive, equitable access to high-quality humanities and qualitative social science scholarship for diverse, global audiences;

          * Increase the number of accessible, open learning resources for students that are instantly available, downloadable, and free of DRM restrictions;

          * Expand the demonstrated opportunity for increased visibility and impact that open access provides to all authors, without the inequities of “pay to publish”;

          * Demonstrate support for a non-profit infrastructure and sustainable business model, on a platform that already hosts other university press content and collections;

          * Inspire the leaders of parent institutions to financially support their presses in more sustainable and open approaches to monograph publishing.

Working with LYRASIS, the University of Michigan Press has been taking steps to develop a publishing program that aligns with its mission and commitment to equity, justice, inclusion, and accessibility. Based on these principles, the Press is now transitioning to an open access monograph model we call “Fund to Mission.” 

Fund to Mission demonstrates a return to the origins of the [university press movement](https://aupresses.org/the-value-of-university-presses/) and moves toward a
more open, sustainable infrastructure for the humanities and social sciences.
