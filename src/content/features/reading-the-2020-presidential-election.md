          It is only in the last 250 years that ordinary people (in some parts of the world) have become citizens rather than subjects. This change happened in a very short period, between 1780 and 1820, a result of the foundations of democracy laid in the age of revolutions. A century later local governments embraced this shift due to rapid industrialization, urbanization, and population growth. During the twentieth century, all democratic governments began to perform a range of tasks, functions, and services that had no historical precedent. In the thirty years following the Second World War, Western democracies created welfare states that, for the first time in history, significantly reduced the gap between the wealthy and everyone else. Many of the reforms of that postwar period have been since rolled back because of the belief that government should be more like a business. Jos C.N. Raadschelders provides the information that all citizens should have about their connections to government, why there is a government, what it does, how it does it, and why we can no longer do without it. *The Three Ages of Government* rises above stereotypical thinking to show the centrality of government in human life.

          quote: In a remarkable turn of events—especially given the long history of
            punitive social policies that leave recipients feeling policed,
            distrusted, and alienated—government-funded after-school programs
            quietly become powerful forces for political and civic engagement.

            text: Based on the writings of an ancient Greek historian, this theory states
              that a dominant nation will inevitably be provoked to war when
              another country strengthens its power; it's a scenario of
              "either/or", not "both/and."

            title: What's the Motive?
            text: Power-transition theory claims that the danger of war is only present when
              a rising power is motivated to revise the status quo, suggesting
              that it's not the dominant power that throws the gauntlet.

            title: The United States vs. China
            text: Chan argues that current Sino-American relations cannot be reduced to
              these theories, and that war between the two nations can be
              avoided by observing lessons learned from past accommodation of
              rising states.

        book: Black America in the Shadow of the Sixties
        quote:
          quote: The long shadow of the Sixties can unwittingly shroud present-day
            political imagination, deadening our ability to properly
            conceptualize, and therefore contest, the dominant forms of racial
            oppression and economic injustice that define the early 21st
            century.

            title: A Decade Unlike Any Other
            text: The mythology of "the Sixties" encompasses many global events and changing
              dynamics, and how we remember it influences the approaches to
              potential social change today.

            title: Impact on Black Politics
            text: The working class that advanced much of the change of the '60s has been
              overshadowed by the "post-civil rights" black middle class.

            title: The Neoliberal Backlash
            text: In the 1970s and beyond, neoliberalism and its hallmarks of economic
              laissez-faire fueled the nation's swing to the political right and
              the updated racism, economic stringency, and vindictiveness of the
              U.S. social policy.

          “When a reality television personality becomes the President of the
          United States, it’s time to pay attention to what television can tell
          us about politics. Stephen Benedict Dyson has the unusual ability to
          bridge political science and popular culture and find the “useful
          fictions” in both.”\

        book: Muslims in a Post-9/11 America
        quote:
          quote: The tremendous amount of resources put toward tracking these Muslim
            American communities may have actually been counterproductive in
            making the country safer and eroded confidence in American
            institutions.

            title: Freedom or Security
            text: The changes in national policy following 9/11 changed the way of life for
              all Americans, restricting some civil liberties in exchange for
              security

            title: Compliant, Yet Alienated
            text: Studies show that Muslim Americans largely support law enforcement
              initiatives to protect the U.S. However, some counter violent
              extremism efforts threaten that relationship by violating the
              rights of nonviolent, noncriminal Muslim citizens.

**Dialogues in Democracy** is an interdisciplinary collection of University of Michigan Press books that explore the core tensions in American political culture. These tensions erupt every four years during the presidential election, but they also shape our daily experiences of democracy outside the voting booth. This dynamic reading list offers an opportunity for students to experience the richest, most comprehensive scholarship available today. Readers will find books that contextualize their own experiences of voting in America. They will also find big picture analyses of leadership, activism, and international pressures, as well as critiques of the democratic processes that control who gets to sit in the chair, and who gets to pull the lever.
