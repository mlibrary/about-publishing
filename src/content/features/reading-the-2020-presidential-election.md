          quote: "No matter the area of legislative activity, the underlying story is
            always the same: for any activity a member of Congress engages in
            that is designed to get the attention or win the affection of
            voters, female members simply do it more."

            title: Three Main Electoral Hurdles
            text: All women candidates, challengers and incumbents alike, face pervasive
              gender stereotypes; a greater likelihood of facing more and
              better-quality challengers; and media coverage that is low quality
              and more focused on women’s appearance and traits.

            text: Female officeholders, as compared to males, will concentrate more of their

              the highest reelection payoffs.

            title: Producing Desired Effects
            text: Through their work in office, women more faithfully represent all of their

Democracy and Debate is an interdisciplinary collection of 25 books that explore the core tensions in American political culture—tensions that erupt every four years during the presidential election. Intended as a companion to the University of Michigan's Democracy and Debate teaching and learning efforts this fall, or to anyone who wishes to better understand the context for the United States' democratic institutions and conflicts, the Press’s 2020 presidential election reading list offers an opportunity for students to experience the richest, most comprehensive scholarship available today. Readers will find books that contextualize their own experiences of voting in America, perhaps, as well as big picture analyses of leadership, activism, and international pressures, as well as critiques of the democratic processes that control who gets to sit in the chair, and who gets to pull the lever.
