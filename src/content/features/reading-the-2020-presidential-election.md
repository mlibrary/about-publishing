          quote: "No matter the area of legislative activity, the underlying story is
            always the same: for any activity a member of Congress engages in
            that is designed to get the attention or win the affection of
            voters, female members simply do it more."

            title: Three Main Electoral Hurdles
            text: All women candidates, challengers and incumbents alike, face pervasive
              gender stereotypes; a greater likelihood of facing more and
              better-quality challengers; and media coverage that is low quality
              and more focused on women’s appearance and traits.

            title: Gendered Behavior
            text: Female officeholders, as compared to males, will concentrate more of their
              efforts on constituent-related activities and those that provide
              the highest reelection payoffs.

          from Brian F. Schaffner, author of *Campaign Finance and Political
          Polarization*, explores the paradox of our passion for politics: we're
          more informed than ever, but many of us are also less politically
          active."

        book: State of Empowerment
        quote:
          quote: In a remarkable turn of events—especially given the long history of
            punitive social policies that leave recipients feeling policed,
            distrusted, and alienated—government-funded after-school programs
            quietly become powerful forces for political and civic engagement.

            title: Investment in After-School Programs
            text: In 2015, U.S. governments spent $25 million to support programs aiming to
              enrich youth development and boost academic performance through
              recreational activities, homework help, and extra instructions

            text: Public policy, diffused through its features and administrative
              organizations, conveys messages about government and social
              attitudes that can influence citizens' interest and capacity for
              participation

            text: After-school programs have substantial guidelines on how to engage parents
              that have the capacity to positively shape parents' experience
              with these programs, as well as their communities and civic
              action.

        book: Thucydides's Trap?
        quote:
          quote: It is important to recognize that great-power wars can happen in the
            absence of any power transition and when one or more belligerents
            were not motivated by a revisionist agenda.

            title: What is "Thucydides's Trap"?
            text: Based on the writings of an ancient Greek historian, this theory states
              that a dominant nation will inevitably be provoked to war when
              another country strengthens its power; it's a scenario of
              "either/or", not "both/and."
          - image: ""
            image_alt: ""
            title: What's the Motive?
            text: Power-transition theory claims that the danger of war is only present when
              a rising power is motivated to revise the status quo, suggesting
              that it's not the dominant power that throws the gauntlet.
          - image: ""
            image_alt: ""
            title: The United States vs. China
            text: Chan argues that current Sino-American relations cannot be reduced to
              these theories, and that war between the two nations can be
              avoided by observing lessons learned from past accommodation of
              rising states.

              these "mutually-reinforcing hyper-partisan sites" for all groups,

          quote: The long shadow of the Sixties can unwittingly shroud present-day

            oppression and economic injustice that define the early 21st

              laissez-faire fueled the nation's swing to the political right and

Democracy and Debate is an interdisciplinary collection of 25 books that explore the core tensions in American political culture—tensions that erupt every four years during the presidential election. Intended as a companion to the University of Michigan's Democracy and Debate teaching and learning efforts this fall, or to anyone who wishes to better understand the context for the United States' democratic institutions and conflicts, the Press’s 2020 presidential election reading list offers an opportunity for students to experience the richest, most comprehensive scholarship available today. Readers will find books that contextualize their own experiences of voting in America, perhaps, as well as big picture analyses of leadership, activism, and international pressures, as well as critiques of the democratic processes that control who gets to sit in the chair, and who gets to pull the lever.
