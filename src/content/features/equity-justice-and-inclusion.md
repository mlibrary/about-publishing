        book: "Bad Boys: Public Schools in the Making of Black Masculinity"
        quote:
          quote: ' Bad Boys is an incisive critique of the ways in which public schools
            help to create and shape perceptions black masculinity. Rather than
            emulate others who have linked the demise of urban schools to the
            troubles of inner-city minority youth, Ferguson turns this issue on
            its head by highlighting how urban school practices can have a
            devastating impact on African-American children."'

The University of Michigan Press publishes books in the humanities and social sciences that seek to make sense of society and culture. As part of this work, UMP is fostering a more inclusive academic publishing program, one that embraces and supports equity, justice, and inclusion. The titles and resources featured below exemplify our work so far, but we recognize that combatting exclusion is a continual work in progress. As part of the University of Michigan Library, the Press is an integral part of [the Diversity Strategic Plan](https://lib.umich.edu/about-us/about-library/diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility/diversity-strategic-plan), which sets out the practical steps we are taking to advance [this equity, justice, and inclusion](https://www.press.umich.edu/about#equity) mission.
