        book: Black America in the Shadow of the Sixties
        quote:
          quote: "The long shadow of the Sixties can unwittingly shroud present-day
            political imagination, deadening our ability to properly
            conceptualize, and therefore contest, the dominant forms of racial
            oppression and economic injustice that define the early 21st
            century. "

            title: A Decade Unlike Any Other
            text: The mythology of "the Sixties" encompasses many global events and changing
              dynamics, and how we remember it influences the approaches to
              potential social change today.

            title: Impact on Black Politics
            text: The working class that advanced much of the change of the '60s has been
              overshadowed by the "post-civil rights" black middle class.

            title: The Neoliberal Backlash
            text: In the 1970s and beyond, neoliberalism and its hallmarks of economic
              laissez-faire fueled the nation's swing to the political right and
              the updated racism, economic stringency, and vindictiveness of the
              U.S. social policy.

        book: Everybody In, Nobody Out
        quote:
          quote: Everybody in, nobody out has become a mantra in trying to ensure that
            whatever I do is inclusive, accessible, and not reserved for the
            happy few.

The University of Michigan Press strongly supports the struggle for racial justice. We publish books in the humanities and social sciences that seek to make sense of society and culture.

This guide is by no means exhaustive and is limited to items published by UMP.

The work of equity, justice, and inclusion is never done. UMP will continue to acquire titles that represent Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) and develop strategies that improve equitable access to our publications.
