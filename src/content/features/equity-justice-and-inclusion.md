          quote: Everybody in, nobody out has become a mantra in trying to ensure that

The University of Michigan Press strongly supports the struggle for racial justice. We publish books in the humanities and social sciences that seek to make sense of society and culture.

This guide is by no means exhaustive and is limited to items published by UMP.

The work of equity, justice, and inclusion is never done. UMP will continue to acquire titles that represent Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) and develop strategies that improve equitable access to our publications.
