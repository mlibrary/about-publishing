        book: Black America in the Shadow of the Sixties
        quote:
          quote: "The long shadow of the Sixties can unwittingly shroud present-day
            political imagination, deadening our ability to properly
            conceptualize, and therefore contest, the dominant forms of racial
            oppression and economic injustice that define the early 21st
            century. "

            text: The mythology of "the Sixties" encompasses many global events and changing
              dynamics, and how we remember it influences the approaches to
              potential social change today.

            title: The Neoliberal Backlash
            text: In the 1970s and beyond, neoliberalism and its hallmarks of economic
              laissez-faire fueled the nation's swing to the political right and
              the updated racism, economic stringency, and vindictiveness of the
              U.S. social policy.

The University of Michigan Press strongly supports the struggle for racial justice. We publish books in the humanities and social sciences that seek to make sense of society and culture. Because we are part of a system that has long contributed to white supremacy, we must and will question through whose lens those concepts are constructed.

We seek to increase the participation of Black, indigenous, and people of color in our publishing as authors, domain experts, and selectors. We commit to develop an anti-racist workplace climate, improving our shared awareness of the language and systems that serve to perpetuate racism so we can change them. We will also continue to develop strategies that improve equitable access to our publications, recognizing that current systems exclude many readers who need the important works that we publish but cannot access them.
