          As the scholarly publishing arm of the University of Michigan,
          University of Michigan Press publishes over 100 books a year in topics
          ranging from disability studies to African studies, from performing
          arts to political science. Over the last few years, the Press has been
          on a journey toward publishing in a more equitable, just, and
          inclusive way. This extends from seeking out marginalized voices,
          through reexamining how titles are accepted, to increasing access.
          Acknowledging that there is still far to go, Dr. Elizabeth Demers, the
          Editorial Director of the Press, will discuss the steps taken so far
          and future directions that the Press and other publishers can take.
          She will be joined by some special guests.


          The event is free-of-charge online but pre-registration is required.

          “As a public university with a mission to serve society, we must use
          our intellectual power and commitment to advocacy as instruments to
          defeat an unjust system, advance anti-racism and dismantle systems of
          oppression.”

      make sure that everyone has the same chance of getting there. These books

        book: "Bad Boys: Public Schools in the Making of Black Masculinity"
        quote:
          quote: Rather than link the demise of urban schools to the troubles of
            inner-city minority youth, the book turns this issue on its head by
            highlighting how urban school practices can have a devastating
            impact on African-American children.
