          The second season of Michigan Publishing's limited podcast series,
          Open Access: In Conversation, explores the theme of this year’s
          International Open Access Week, “It Matters How We Open Knowledge:
          Building Structural Equity.” Through this series, we talk to a range
          of stakeholders—*including students, authors, libraries, researchers,
          and publishers*—addressing questions around open access and the
          implications of open access for diversity, equity, inclusion, and
          accessibility.

          Working with LYRASIS, the University of Michigan Press has been taking
          steps to develop a publishing program that aligns with its mission and
          commitment to equity, justice, inclusion, and accessibility. Based on
          these principles, the Press is now transitioning to an open access
          monograph model we call Fund to Mission.


          Fund to Mission demonstrates a return to the origins of the university press movement and moves toward a more open, sustainable infrastructure for the humanities and social sciences.

[Open Access Week](http://openaccessweek.org/), a global event organized by [SPARC](https://sparcopen.org/), is an opportunity for the academic and research community to continue to learn about the potential benefits of open access and to help inspire wider participation in helping to make open access a new norm in scholarship and research. The theme for the 2021 week is "It Matters How We Open Knowledge: Building Structural Equity."

At Michigan Publishing, open access is one of many ways that we strive to deliver the best scholarship to the broadest possible audience. Over the last decade, Michigan Publishing has been taking steps to develop a publishing program that better aligns with our mission and commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility. We are excited to highlight some of those efforts and share new open access initiatives below.
