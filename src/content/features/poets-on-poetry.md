Michigan Press and Publishing’s Poets on Poetry series was founded on a premise: to collect “critical works by contemporary poets, gathering together the articles, interviews, and book reviews by which they have articulated the poetics of a new generation.” In order to further these stated aims of the Poets on Poetry series and develop them in innovative and exciting new directions, Michigan Publishing is launching a digitization pilot project with an aim to reinvigorate interest in the Poets on Poetry series and at the same time demonstrate the creative and educative possibilities of a broader series digitization initiative. The idea behind this project is to create and implement a proof of concept for a Poets on Poetry digital collection, with an eye to digitizing the entire series in the near future.

For our project, we have selected 10 texts that we believe represent the rich and various array of voices found in the extant volumes of the Poets on Poetry series: Robert Hayden’s *Collected Prose* (1984), Donald Hall’s *Death to the Death of Poetry* (1995), Joy Harjo’s *The Spiral of Memory* (1996), John Ashbery’s *Selected Prose* (2004), Alice Notley’s *Coming After* (2005), John Yau’s *The Passionate Spectator* (2006), Sandra M. Gilbert’s *On Burning Ground* (2009), Yusef Komunyakaa’s *Condition Red* (2017), Rigoberto González’s *Pivotal Voices, Era of Transition* (2017), and Claudia Keelan’s *Ecstatic Émigré* (2018).
