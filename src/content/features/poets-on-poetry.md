          How do we read poetry? How do we review it, critique it, teach it, and
          bring it into our conversations about the value of literature both in
          our classrooms and beyond? 


          The *Poets on Poetry* series offers many exciting inroads for thinking about how we read and engage with poetry in both scholarly and public life. In order to think pedagogically about the Poets on Poetry series, University of Michigan PhD candidate and Michigan Publishing intern Amanda Kubic has created a [syllabus project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwXiiZl8KbdH67gkLRFXiUO5akYAsc1O8vZUf9LCnzk/edit?usp=sharing) that demonstrates how instructors can teach selected texts and supplementary materials from the *Poets on Poetry* series in the university classroom. 


          The project contains five modules that university instructors can adopt or adapt to teach a selection of materials from *Poets on Poetry* and relevant supplementary content. The modules have been organized by theme: performing poetry, poetry and visual art, poetry and revision, poetry and the public, and emerging voices in poetry. These modules can be incorporated into a variety of syllabi and are ideal for an undergraduate English course or creative writing course. Each module comes with a set of driving questions to guide the discussion of the material, a selection of readings, and proposed assignments to help students comprehend and engage with the material. See the following sample module on "Poetry and Visual Art":




          * ![**Module Two: Poetry and Visual Art**  **\*Guiding Questions:** How can we put the textual qualities of poetry into conversation with the visual qualities of mediums like sculpture, painting, and collage? What language can we use to talk about the poetics of visual art and the visual aspects of poetry? What kinds of distinctions do we make between texts and other kinds of media, and for what purpose? What do spaces like museums or art galleries have to offer to our discussions of poetry and poetics? What does it mean to be a critic/scholar/spectator of poetry vs. of visual art?*  ***Readings:***  * John Yau, “The Poet as Art Critic” and “Street Song: The Art of Jean-Michel Basquiat and the Poetry of Kevin Young” from *The Passionate Spectator: Essays on Art and Poetry* (2006), pp. 40-65, 87-101. Please also view Basquiat’s painting *Hollywood Africans* (1983), available here: <https://whitney.org/collection/works/453>. * John Ashbery, “Poetical Space” from *Selected Prose* (2004), pp. 210-216. * Alice Notley, “Ron Padgett’s Visual Imagination” from *Coming After* (2005), pp. 27-41. * Robert Hayden, selections from “A Romantic Realist” and “The Poet and His Art: A Conversation” from *Collected Prose* (1984), pp.125-128, 202-203. Please also read Hayden’s “The Peacock Room” (1975) and “Monet’s ‘Water Lilies’” (1970); and view Monet’s painting *Water Lilies* (1906), available here: <https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16568/water-lilies>.  ***Assignment:***  * *Plan a visit to your local museum, or find a museum website that is of interest to you (for example, the University of Michigan Museum of Art offers free reservations to students, and the website can be found here: <https://umma.umich.edu/>). Select a piece of visual art at your chosen museum that you think speaks to the concept of “poetics.” It may remind you of a particular poem, inspire a poem of your own, or have qualities that you find “poetic” in a broader sense. After you have selected your visual art piece, take a few minutes to write down 1) what you notice about the piece (colors, textures, shapes, familiar figures, strange or unexpected details, etc.) 2) why you think these details might matter. Drawing from your notes, write a brief essay on the connections you are making between your visual art piece and poetry/poetics. What details are key to your analysis? How do you articulate a visual piece’s poetics? What elements of the piece resist meaning or interpretation?*](/assets/screen-shot-2021-07-19-at-3.28.40-pm.jpg "Module Two: Poetry and Visual Art ")


          Our hope that these modules will serve as a valuable resource for instructors looking to engage with contemporary critical conversations about poetry and poetics.

Michigan Press and Publishing’s Poets on Poetry series was founded on a vision: to collect “critical works by contemporary poets, gathering together the articles, interviews, and book reviews by which they have articulated the poetics of a new generation.” To further the aims of the Poets on Poetry series, which began with series founder Donald Hall, and to develop them in innovative and exciting new directions, Michigan Publishing has launched a digitization pilot project with an aim to reinvigorate interest in the Poets on Poetry series and at the same time demonstrate the creative and educative possibilities of a broader series digitization initiative in the near future. 

For our pilot project, we have selected ten texts that represent the rich and various array of voices found in the extant volumes of the Poets on Poetry series: Robert Hayden’s *Collected Prose* (1984), Donald Hall’s *Death to the Death of Poetry* (1995), Joy Harjo’s *The Spiral of Memory* (1996), John Ashbery’s *Selected Prose* (2004), Alice Notley’s *Coming After* (2005), John Yau’s *The Passionate Spectator* (2006), Sandra M. Gilbert’s *On Burning Ground* (2009), Yusef Komunyakaa’s *Condition Red* (2017), Rigoberto González’s *Pivotal Voices, Era of Transition* (2017), and Claudia Keelan’s *Ecstatic Émigré* (2018). The authors we have chosen for this digital relaunch of Poets on Poetry come from a variety of communities, backgrounds, and poetic sensibilities, and their works have helped shape our vision for the series' future. 

Our goal is to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the Michigan Publishing [Fulcrum platform](https://www-fulcrum-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/) to curate a selection of interactive and accessible digital texts and to supplement these texts with other related materials (performances, interviews and conversations, images, pedagogical tools, and paratexts) linked directly to the Ebooks. These digitized texts and supplementary materials will be an invaluable resource to poets, scholars, and educators looking to engage with contemporary critical discussions about poetry and poetics.
