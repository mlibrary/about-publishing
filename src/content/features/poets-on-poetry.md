Michigan Press and Publishing’s Poets on Poetry series was founded on a vision: to collect “critical works by contemporary poets, gathering together the articles, interviews, and book reviews by which they have articulated the poetics of a new generation.” To further the aims of the Poets on Poetry series, which began with series founder Donald Hall, and to develop them in innovative and exciting new directions, Michigan Publishing has launched a digitization pilot project with an aim to reinvigorate interest in the Poets on Poetry series and at the same time demonstrate the creative and educative possibilities of a broader series digitization initiative in the near future. 

For our pilot project, we have selected ten texts that represent the rich and various array of voices found in the extant volumes of the Poets on Poetry series: Robert Hayden’s *Collected Prose* (1984), Donald Hall’s *Death to the Death of Poetry* (1995), Joy Harjo’s *The Spiral of Memory* (1996), John Ashbery’s *Selected Prose* (2004), Alice Notley’s *Coming After* (2005), John Yau’s *The Passionate Spectator* (2006), Sandra M. Gilbert’s *On Burning Ground* (2009), Yusef Komunyakaa’s *Condition Red* (2017), Rigoberto González’s *Pivotal Voices, Era of Transition* (2017), and Claudia Keelan’s *Ecstatic Émigré* (2018). The authors we have chosen for this digital relaunch of Poets on Poetry come from a variety of communities, backgrounds, and poetic sensibilities, and their works have helped shape our vision for the series' future. 

Our goal is to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the Michigan Publishing [Fulcrum platform](https://www-fulcrum-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/) to curate a selection of interactive and accessible digital texts and to supplement these texts with other related materials (performances, interviews and conversations, images, pedagogical tools, and paratexts) linked directly to the Ebooks. These digitized texts and supplementary materials will be an invaluable resource to poets, scholars, and educators looking to engage with contemporary critical discussions about poetry and poetics.
