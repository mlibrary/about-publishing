          The *Poets on Poetry* series offers many exciting inroads for thinking
          about how we read and engage with poetry in both scholarly and public
          life. In order to think pedagogically about the *Poets on Poetry*
          series, University of Michigan PhD candidate, Rackham Fellow, and
          University instructor Amanda Kubic has created a [syllabus
          project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwXiiZl8KbdH67gkLRFXiUO5akYAsc1O8vZUf9LCnzk/edit?usp=sharing)
          that demonstrates how instructors can teach selected texts and
          supplementary materials from the *Poets on Poetry* series in the
          university classroom. 


          The project contains five modules that university instructors can adopt or adapt to teach a selection of materials from *Poets on Poetry* and relevant supplementary content. The modules have been organized by theme: performing poetry, poetry and visual art, poetry and revision, poetry and the public, and emerging voices in poetry. These modules can be incorporated into a variety of syllabi and are ideal for an undergraduate English course or creative writing course. Each module comes with a set of driving questions to guide the discussion of the material, a selection of readings, and proposed assignments to help students comprehend and engage with the material. See the following sample module on "Poetry and Visual Art":


          * ![Module 2: Poetry and Visual Art   Guiding Questions: How can we put the textual qualities of poetry into conversation with the visual qualities of mediums like sculpture, painting, and collage? What language can we use to talk about the poetics of visual art and the visual aspects of poetry? What kinds of distinctions do we make between texts and other kinds of media, and for what purpose? What do spaces like museums or art galleries have to offer to our discussions of poetry and poetics? What does it mean to be a critic/scholar/spectator of poetry vs. of visual art?   Readings: John Yau, “The Poet as Art Critic” and “Street Song: The Art of Jean-Michel Basquiat and the Poetry of Kevin Young” from The Passionate Spectator: Essays on Art and Poetry (2006), pp. 40-65, 87-101. Please also view Basquiat’s painting Hollywood Africans (1983), available here: https://whitney.org/collection/works/453.   Kazim Ali, “Poet Crossing Borders” from Resident Alien (2015), pp. 121-151.   Alice Notley, “Ron Padgett’s Visual Imagination” from Coming After (2005), pp. 27-41.  Robert Hayden, selections from “A Romantic Realist” and “The Poet and His Art: A Conversation” from Collected Prose (1984), pp.125-128, 202-203. Please also read Hayden’s “The Peacock Room” (1975) and “Monet’s ‘Water Lilies’” (1970); and view Monet’s painting Water Lilies (1906), available here: https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16568/water-lilies.  Assignment: Plan a visit to your local museum, or find a museum website that is of interest to you (for example, the University of Michigan Museum of Art offers free reservations to students, and the website can be found here: https://umma.umich.edu/). Select a piece of visual art at your chosen museum that you think speaks to the concept of “poetics.” It may remind you of a particular poem, inspire a poem of your own, or have qualities that you find “poetic” in a broader sense.  After you have selected your visual art piece, take a few minutes to write down 1) what you notice about the piece (colors, textures, shapes, familiar figures, strange or unexpected details, etc.) 2) why you think these details might matter. Drawing from your notes, write a brief essay on the connections you are making between your visual art piece and poetry/poetics. What details are key to your analysis? How do you articulate a visual piece’s poetics? What elements of the piece resist meaning or interpretation? ](/assets/screen-shot-2021-07-21-at-10.33.05-am.jpg "Module Two: Poetry and Visual Art ")


          We hope these modules will be a valuable resource for instructors looking to engage with contemporary critical conversations about poetry and poetics.

          Donald Hall was a keen observer and an impassioned advocate for
          poetry. In this, he followed in the tradition—or tradition*s,*
          plural—of the many forebears whose poetry fueled his own. He founded
          the *Poets on Poetry* series to remind us not only of the pleasures of
          poetry and the importance of creative expression but also of the
          perils we face whenever we ignore the caged bird’s song or continue to
          defer the dream Langston Hughes writes about so poignantly and so
          urgently in “Harlem.”


          For the past six decades, the *Poets on Poetry* series has provided a forum for contemporary poets to speak—oftentimes boldly—to the issue of why poetry matters. “Gathering together the articles, interviews, and book reviews by which \[these poets] have articulated the poetics of a new generation,” titles in the series have presented readers with an open invitation to follow—and equally to contribute to—a rich and varied dialogue about what role literature and the arts play in society, about the shifting sands of cultural production and consumption, even about what poetry is and why it matters where and from whom our definitions may have originated.


          The series catalogue exemplifies the commitment the University of Michigan Press has long had to fostering a dialogue as diverse and inclusive as it is well-considered and engaging. Spanning the decades since the 1978 publication of William Stafford’s *Writing the Australian Crawl,* the series has published books by Meena Alexander, Kazim Ali, MartÍn Espada, Sandra M. Gilbert, Rigoberto González, Thom Gunn, Joy Harjo, Robert Hayden, Yusef Komunyakaa, Natasha Saje, Anne Sexton, and John Yau, among a host of other luminaries.


          And this meaningful proliferation of voices and perspectives is being further amplified digitally. Through an innovative initiative—the scope and details of which you see here—past and future *Poets on Poetry* titles will include an interactive EPUB edition. These EPUBs will feature supplemental content such as online articles, video recordings of book festival events, poetry films, and audio recordings of interviews, making the material on the page (or screen) come alive in new and exciting ways and creating an even more immersive—and accessible—reading experience.


          The editorial team is also readying an expanded digital publishing calendar that will include short-form, multimedia, and serialized content in addition to the print books and EPUBs that have been the signature of the series to this point.


          It is a particularly exhilarating time for the *Poets on Poetry* Series, and I am hopeful that these additional avenues for exploring poetry and celebrating the poets who make it—and make it matter to us in all the ways that it does—succeed in welcoming even more voices to the conversation Donald Hall and the other exceptional editors who preceded me have helped to frame by publishing the books they did.

University of Michigan Press'[ *Poets on Poetry*](https://www.press.umich.edu/browse/series/UM31) series was founded on a vision: to collect “critical works by contemporary poets, gathering together the articles, interviews, and book reviews by which they have articulated the poetics of a new generation.” To further the aims of the *Poets on Poetry* series, which began in 1978 with series founder Donald Hall, and to develop them in innovative and exciting new directions, University of Michigan Press has launched a digital transformation pilot project with an aim to reinvigorate interest in the *Poets on Poetry* series and at the same time demonstrate the creative and educative possibilities of a broader series digitization initiative in the near future. 

For our pilot project, we have selected ten texts that represent the rich and various array of voices found in the extant volumes of the *Poets on Poetry* series: Robert Hayden’s *[Collected Prose](https://www-fulcrum-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/concern/monographs/rr172025j)* (1984), Donald Hall’s *[Death to the Death of Poetry](https://www-fulcrum-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/concern/monographs/vd66w187p)* (1995), Joy Harjo’s *[The Spiral of Memory](https://www-fulcrum-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/concern/monographs/xp68kj628)* (1996), Alice Notley’s *[Coming After](https://www-fulcrum-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/concern/monographs/d791sh06p)* (2005), John Yau’s *[The Passionate Spectator](https://www-fulcrum-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/concern/monographs/08612r02r)* (2006), Sandra M. Gilbert’s *[On Burning Ground](https://www-fulcrum-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/concern/monographs/cc08hh95g)* (2009), Kazim Ali's *[Resident Alien](https://www-fulcrum-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/concern/monographs/h989r406g)* (2015), Yusef Komunyakaa’s *[Condition Red](https://www-fulcrum-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/concern/monographs/r494vk93b)* (2017), Rigoberto González’s *[Pivotal Voices, Era of Transition](https://www-fulcrum-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/concern/monographs/t148fh81z)* (2017), and Claudia Keelan’s *[Ecstatic Émigré](https://www-fulcrum-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/concern/monographs/k35695320)* (2018). The authors we have chosen for this digital relaunch of *Poets on Poetry* come from a variety of communities, backgrounds, and poetic sensibilities, and their works have helped shape our vision for the series' future. 

Our goal is to take advantage of the opportunities provided by Michigan Publishing's [Fulcrum platform](https://www-fulcrum-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/) to curate a selection of interactive and accessible digital texts and to supplement these texts with other related materials (performances, interviews and conversations, images, pedagogical tools, and paratexts) linked to the EPUBs. These digitized texts and supplementary materials will be an invaluable resource to poets, scholars, and educators looking to engage with contemporary critical discussions about poetry and poetics.
