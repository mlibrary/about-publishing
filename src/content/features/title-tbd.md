            text: In 1981, the University of Michigan Center for Japanese Studies launched
              the U.S.-Japan Automotive Conference (USJAC). Held annually until
              1989, the USJAC facilitated reasoned dialogue between U.S. and
              Japanese business, political, and labor leaders against a backdrop
              of increasingly heated competition between the two countries’ auto
              industries.

              auto industry were dramatically transformed via Japanese
              producers. Automobiles and the Future: Competition, Cooperation,
              and Change captures many of the critical factors responsible for
              these changes."

        text: Digitalization is reshaping culture and communication in the twenty-first
          century. Digital platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, and others are
          deeply embedded in the daily lives of millions of people around the
          world, shaping how people engage with others as kin, as citizens, and
          as consumers. The essays in this book explore the intersections of
          local, national, regional, and global forces that shape contemporary
          digital culture(s) in regions like South Asia.

The Asian Studies program at the University of Michigan Press showcases rich, global scholarship, providing deep cultural, historical, and political knowledge of these regions in their international context. Focused on providing a place of intersections, with books examining the historical and the contemporary, the Asian Studies lists expands—and often challenges—our understanding in regional history and politics, cultural and literary studies, media and performance. 

In August 2020, UMP launched the Michigan Asian Studies Open Access Books Collection, a collection of 100 significant books about Asia made freely and publicly available online. Jointly sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Humanities Open Book Program makes outstanding out-of-print humanities books available to a wide audience.
