        text: Definitions of disability underpin fundamental concepts such as normalcy,
          health, bodily integrity, individuality, citizenship, and morality—all
          terms that define the essence of what it means to be human. Rarely has
          disability been approached as a constructed category forwarded by
          social institutions seeking to legislate the slippery line that exists
          between normative biologies and deviant bodies. Subtitled "Discourses
          of Disability" this University of Michigan Press book series
          identifies the social phantasms that have been projected upon disabled
          subjects in history and theorizes the shifting coordinates of disabled
          identities.

        heading: "Diaphanous Bodies: Ability, Disability, and Modernist Irish
          Literature"
        text: >
          This book by Jeremy Colangelo examines ability, as a category of
          embodiment and embodied experience, and in the process opens up a new
          area of inquiry in the growing field of literary disability studies.
          It argues that the construction of ability arises through a process of
          exclusion and forgetting, in which the depiction of sensory
          information and epistemological judgment subtly (or sometimes
          un-subtly) elide the fact of embodied subjectivity.

          Production
        text: Weaving between the historical context of Mexico’s post-revolutionary
          period and our present-day world, this title by Susan Antebi
          approaches literary and archival documents that include anti-alcohol
          and hygiene campaigns; projects in school architecture and
          psychopedagogy; biotypological studies of urban schoolchildren and
          indigenous populations; and literary approaches to futuristic utopias
          or violent pasts.

        heading: Beholding Disability in Renaissance England
        text: >
          Uncovers crucial counterdiscourses circulating in the English
          Renaissance that opposed cultural fantasies of ability and had a keen
          sensibility toward non-normative embodiments. Hobgood reads
          impairments as varied as epilepsy, stuttering, disfigurement,
          deafness, chronic pain, blindness, and castration in order to
          understand not just powerful fictions of ability present during the
          Renaissance but also the somewhat paradoxical, surprising ways these
          ableist ideals provided creative fodder for many Renaissance writers
          and thinkers.

Disabilities have been traditionally treated as conditions in need of medical intervention and correction. Rarely has disability been approached as a constructed category forwarded by social institutions seeking to legislate the slippery line that exists between normative biologies and deviant bodies. Michigan Publishing advances ongoing scholarly efforts to conceive of a more humane constellation of narratives about physical and cognitive difference as well as striving to make its publications as accessible as possible to disabled readers.
