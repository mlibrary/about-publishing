        text: Definitions of disability underpin fundamental concepts such as normalcy,
          health, bodily integrity, individuality, citizenship, and morality—all
          terms that define the essence of what it means to be human. Rarely has
          disability been approached as a constructed category forwarded by
          social institutions seeking to legislate the slippery line that exists
          between normative biologies and deviant bodies. Corporealities
          identifies the social phantasms that have been projected upon disabled
          subjects in history and aims to theorize the shifting coordinates of
          disabled identities.

        text: >
          Diaphanous Bodies examines ability, as a category of embodiment and
          embodied experience, and in the process opens up a new area of inquiry
          in the growing field of literary disability studies. It argues that
          the construction of ability arises through a process of exclusion and
          forgetting, in which the depiction of sensory information and
          epistemological judgment subtly (or sometimes un-subtly) elide the
          fact of embodied subjectivity. The result is what Colangelo calls “the
          myth of the diaphanous abled body,” a fiction that holds that an abled
          body is one that does not participate in or situate experience. The
          diaphanous abled body underwrites the myth that abled and disabled
          constitute two distinct categories of being rather than points on a
          constantly shifting continuum.


          Author, Jeremy Colangelo is SSHRC Post-doctoral Fellow at SUNY Buffalo and Lecturer at King's University College at The University of Western Ontario.

Disabilities have been traditionally treated as conditions in need of medical intervention and correction. Rarely has disability been approached as a constructed category forwarded by social institutions seeking to legislate the slippery line that exists between normative biologies and deviant bodies. Michigan Publishing advances ongoing scholarly efforts to conceive of a more humane constellation of narratives about physical and cognitive difference as well as striving to make its publications as accessible as possible to disabled readers.
