          Definitions of disability underpin fundamental concepts such as normalcy, health, bodily integrity, individuality, citizenship, and moralityâ€”all terms that define the essence of what it means to be human. Rarely has disability been approached as a constructed category forwarded by social institutions seeking to legislate the slippery line that exists between normative biologies and deviant bodies. Corporealities identifies the social phantasms that have been projected upon disabled subjects in history and aims to theorize the shifting coordinates of disabled identities.

Disabilities have been traditionally treated as conditions in need of medical intervention and correction. Rarely has disability been approached as a constructed category forwarded by social institutions seeking to legislate the slippery line that exists between normative biologies and deviant bodies. Michigan Publishing advances ongoing scholarly efforts to conceive of a more humane constellation of narratives about physical and cognitive difference as well as striving to make its publications as accessible as possible to disabled readers.
