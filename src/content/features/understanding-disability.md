        text: Definitions of disability underpin fundamental concepts such as normalcy,
          health, bodily integrity, individuality, citizenship, and morality—all
          terms that define the essence of what it means to be human. Rarely has
          disability been approached as a constructed category forwarded by
          social institutions seeking to legislate the slippery line that exists
          between normative biologies and deviant bodies. Corporealities
          identifies the social phantasms that have been projected upon disabled
          subjects in history and aims to theorize the shifting coordinates of
          disabled identities.

        heading: "Diaphanous Bodies: Ability, Disability, and Modernist Irish
          Literature"
        text: >
          Diaphanous Bodies examines ability, as a category of embodiment and
          embodied experience, and in the process opens up a new area of inquiry
          in the growing field of literary disability studies. It argues that
          the construction of ability arises through a process of exclusion and
          forgetting, in which the depiction of sensory information and
          epistemological judgment subtly (or sometimes un-subtly) elide the
          fact of embodied subjectivity. The result is what Colangelo calls “the
          myth of the diaphanous abled body,” a fiction that holds that an abled
          body is one that does not participate in or situate experience. The
          diaphanous abled body underwrites the myth that abled and disabled
          constitute two distinct categories of being rather than points on a
          constantly shifting continuum.

        heading: Embodied Archive Disability in Post-Revolutionary Mexican Cultural
          Production
        text: Weaving between the historical context of Mexico’s post-revolutionary
          period and our present-day world, Embodied Archive approaches literary
          and archival documents that include anti-alcohol and hygiene
          campaigns; projects in school architecture and psychopedagogy;
          biotypological studies of urban schoolchildren and indigenous
          populations; and literary approaches to futuristic utopias or violent
          pasts. It focuses in particular on the way disability is represented
          indirectly through factors that may have caused it in the past or may
          cause it in the future, or through perceptions and measurements that
          cannot fully capture it. In engaging with these narratives, the book
          proposes an archival encounter, a witnessing of past injustices and
          their implications for the disability of our present and future. An
          Open Access ebook has been made possible by support from Victoria
          College at the University of Toronto. Author Susan Antebi is Associate
          Professor of Latin American Literature at the University of Toronto.

Disabilities have been traditionally treated as conditions in need of medical intervention and correction. Rarely has disability been approached as a constructed category forwarded by social institutions seeking to legislate the slippery line that exists between normative biologies and deviant bodies. Michigan Publishing advances ongoing scholarly efforts to conceive of a more humane constellation of narratives about physical and cognitive difference as well as striving to make its publications as accessible as possible to disabled readers.
