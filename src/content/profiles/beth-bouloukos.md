  "Fulcrum has enabled us to improve our brand by providing a platform that
  allows scholars to author the types of multimodal books they have desired for
  many years. As an open access press, we are thinking about accessibility on
  many levels and the Fulcrum team is fully supporting us in that endeavor."
