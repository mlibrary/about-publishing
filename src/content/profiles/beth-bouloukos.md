      Fulcrum has enabled us to improve our brand by providing a platform that
      allows scholars to author the types of multi-modal books they have desired
      for many years. As an open access press, we are thinking about
      accessibility on many levels and the Fulcrum team is fully supporting us
      in that endeavor.
