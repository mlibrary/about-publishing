quotes:
  - quote: '"The NEH Humanities Open Book Michigan Asian Studies Books Collection is
      an important step in making access to knowledge about Asia open access. As
      scholars of Asian societies, most authors hope that their work will not
      only advance specific lines of inquiry in their fields, but also be
      important to the societies with which they engage. By ensuring that these
      scholarly works are available free of charge to scholars and the public in
      Asia, Michigan Publishing leads university presses in promoting equity in
      access to knowledge and supporting scholarly cooperation globally."'
