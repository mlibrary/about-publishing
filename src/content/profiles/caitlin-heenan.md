      Working as an editor on a student-run publication gave me the opportunity
      to work on projects I found meaningful with like-minded people. As an
      editor for the Undergraduate Journal of Public Health, I worked with
      student writers to hone their research, literature reviews, and opinions
      on an array of

      health-related topics. I created lasting relationships with those who are
      passionate about the topics I am also passionate about and learned about
      new fields of research. Michigan Publishing helped our editors stay
      focused on the quality of our publication by taking away the stress of
      having to copy edit,

      typeset, and print the journal ourselves. We also found new outlets to
      share our work with others and expand the reach of our publication through
      a partnership with Michigan Publishing.
