quotes:
  - quote: We were excited to help â€“ not only because helping important U-M research
      like this find its audience is core to what we do, but also because we are
      all very concerned about carbon emissions and their role in climate
      change, and were interested to see how we could help solve this problem as
      members of the campus community.
