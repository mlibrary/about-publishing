  - quote: >-
      The way I see it, publishing and research are, in many ways, complements.
      When you better your skills in one, you better your skills in the other,
      and consequently, working as an editor for UMURJ has improved my own
      abilities to write and verbalize the information gained through my
      research. Iâ€™ve been given this opportunity to look at data from a
      viewpoint that parallels the way in which others view my own data, and it
      has been an experience to ultimately improve the efficacy of my words. Of
      course, for an organization of students with little to no experience in
      professional publishing grounds, the reigns are quite unstable, but
      receiving guidance through institutions such as Michigan Publishing allows
      for the creation of the sturdy foundation needed to prosper and grow. With
      each bit of intelligence gained, I am able to implement change in both my
      own work and that of others to foster a culture of continuous learning
      that is research.
