bio: >-
  As a visual historian, Bertellini is interested in film aesthetics in the
  context of the dense artistic and cultural exchanges across the Atlantic. In
  his first book in English, Italy in Early American Cinema: Race, Landscape,
  and the Picturesque (2009), he followed the historical and geographic journeys
  of an aesthetic form, the picturesque, from 17th century paintings and 18th
  century prints.
