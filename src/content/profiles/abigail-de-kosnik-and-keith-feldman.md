      The Color of New Media stands for inclusivity and accessibility in new
      media studies, so it was deeply important to us that our book be made
      available in an open-access edition. The University of Michigan Press and
      University of California Libraries helped us realize our dream. We are so
      grateful that readers and teachers have multiple options for viewing and
      using our research. We wanted our work to reach as many people as
      possible, and open access is facilitating that goal.
