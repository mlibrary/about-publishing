quotes:
  - quote: One aspect of the commission's charge was to develop scalable and
      transferable models for U-M to achieve carbon neutrality. Thanks to the
      commission's partnership with MPS, the commission's analysis reports and
      final report are now published in an accessible and visible way which
      amplifies the reach and impact of the work beyond the university.
