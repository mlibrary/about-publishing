quotes:
  - quote: It takes special care to make digital content accessible to everyone
      because many common practices in document creation and web design only
      serve fully-sighted users, not people with blindness or other print
      disabilities. For this project, we worked with experts in the U-M
      Library's Accessibility Remediation Program to make sure everyone can
      access the PCCN's publications on Fulcrum and read them in a way that
      suits their needs.
