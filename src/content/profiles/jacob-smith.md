quote: >-
  “Michigan had the vision to recognize the potential for this new model for
  academic publication, and the unique set of skills and infrastructure required
  to make it work. ESC was an exciting and rewarding scholarly and creative
  challenge for me personally…. a once-in-a-career opportunity to radically
  rethink the form that my research might take. From translating my written text
  to spoken voice over, to thinking about production issues like sound design
  and copyright, to moving through a peer review process that involved listening
  to audio files rather than reading and revising written chapters, ESC carved a
  new path through the terrain of academic publication, and Michigan Publishing
  was a wonderful collaborator at every step of the way.”
