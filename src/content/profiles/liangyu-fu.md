  “The release of this collection on Fulcrum will greatly boost the access to
  significant English-language monographs for scholars everywhere, but
  especially for those who reside in China. Print copies of these titles used to
  be mostly distributed only in North America and Europe, making it difficult
  for the scholarly community in China to get full access to these works. The
  revival of these titles through OA ensures equal access around the world.”
