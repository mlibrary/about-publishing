quote: >-
  “Working on the UM Undergraduate Research Journal has been an incredibly
  rewarding experience. Through working on a student journal, I’ve gained
  faculty and student connections around campus, and even at other campuses.
  UMURJ has given me immense satisfaction of seeing a polished print and online
  journal, and a feeling of accomplishment after a year’s hard work. Michigan
  Publishing has been instrumental in this process, especially in bringing a
  handful of articles together into a professional print edition."
