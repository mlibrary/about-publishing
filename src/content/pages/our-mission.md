Michigan Publishing brings together three entities to serve the changing needs of scholars: University of Michigan Press, Michigan Publishing Services, and Deep Blue Repository and Research Data Services. Together, they engage with a spectrum of publishing needs across the life-cycle of scholarly communication and provide guidance and assistance to the University community. 

**We value what we do and the communities behind it.**

[University of Michigan Press](https://www.press.umich.edu/) publishes award-winning books that advance humanities and social science fields, as well as English language teaching and regional resources.

[Michigan Publishing Services](https://www.publishing.umich.edu/services/) assists the U-M community of faculty, staff, and students in achieving their publishing ambitions.

[Deep Blue Repository and Research Data Services](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/) provides a platform for stable, citable, measurable presentation of research outputs and consultation services for scholars.

**Current focus areas.**

As part of the University of Michigan Library, we share its [Mission and Values](https://lib.umich.edu/about-us/about-library/mission-and-values). We co-create and share common [Strategic Directions and Objectives](https://lib.umich.edu/about-us/about-library/strategic-directions-and-objectives). 

**Interested in working on a project with our team?**

We're here to support the publishing aspirations of faculty, researchers, students, and staff across the U-M campus and beyond. We invite you to work with us or reach out with your questions or information about your project.
