**Michigan Publishing combines the strengths of a highly-regarded university press with the innovative, service-oriented approach of a university library renowned as a leader in digital initiatives and technologies.**

For many decades after its founding, publishing at the University of Michigan grew to be diverse and dispersed across the institution. The Press was founded in 1930 as a division of the University Library. Seventy years later, in 2000, the Library created the Scholarly Publishing Office (SPO) to serve the needs of authors and readers. Other activities related to publishing followed, including the creation of Deep Blue in 2006. In 2009, oversight of the University of Michigan Press moved back to the Library. Not long after, all publishing activities were unified under a single brand name, MPublishing, and headed by a newly created position, the Associate University Librarian for Publishing. Michigan Publishing is now the hub of publishing activities undertaken by the University of Michigan Library. 

Today, Michigan Publishing brings together three entities to serve the changing needs of scholars: University of Michigan Press, Michigan Publishing Services, and Deep Blue Repository and Research Data Services. Together they engage with a spectrum of publishing needs across the life-cycle of scholarly communication and provide guidance and assistance to the University community. 

[University of Michigan Press](https://www.press.umich.edu/) publishes award-winning books that advance humanities and social science fields for which the University is well-known.

[Michigan Publishing Services](https://www.publishing.umich.edu/services/) assists the U-M community of faculty, staff, and students in achieving their publishing ambitions.

[Deep Blue Repository and Research Data Services](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/) provides a platform for stable, citable, measurable presentation of digital scholarship, research data, and open access articles by faculty authors.

**We value what we do and the communities behind it.**

Our ten core values unite our team and push us to accomplish our work every day.

Scholarship at its best is collaborative, innovative, and engages and solves the problems of the real world. Michigan Publishing exists to support the creation and spread of knowledge and as a mission-driven organization we aim to live by the following ten values, which interconnect:

* Commitment to rich publication of scholarship
* Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEI+A)
* Durability (Preservation)
* Discoverability (Interoperability)
* Flexibility
* Reusability
* Open Ecosystems (content + infrastructure + values)
