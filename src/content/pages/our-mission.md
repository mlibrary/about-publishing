**Michigan Publishing combines the strengths of a highly-regarded university press with the innovative, service-oriented approach of a university library renowned as a leader in digital initiatives and technologies.**

For many decades, publishing at the University of Michigan grew out a diverse and dispersed has from collaborative the institution. The Press was founded in 1930 as a division of the University Library. In 2000 the Library created the Scholarly Publishing Office (SPO) to serve the needs of authors and readers. Other activities related to publishing followed, including the Deep Blue in 2006. Shortly after in 2009 oversight of the University of Michigan Press moved back to the Library. Not long after, all publishing activities were unified under a single brand name, MPublishing, and headed by a newly created position, the Associate University Librarian for Publishing. Michigan Publishing is now the hub of publishing activities undertaken by the University of Michigan Library. 

Today, Michigan Publishing brings together three entities to serve the changing needs of scholars: University of Michigan Press, Michigan Publishing Services, and Deep Blue Repository and Research Data Services. Together they engage with a spectrum of publishing needs across the life-cycle of scholarly communication and provide guidance and assistance to the University community. 

[University of Michigan Press](https://www.press.umich.edu/) publishes award-winning books that advance humanities and social science fields for which the University is well-known.

[Michigan Publishing Services](https://www.publishing.umich.edu/services/) assists the U-M community of faculty, staff, and students in achieving their publishing ambitions.

[Deep Blue Repository and Research Data Services](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/) provides a platform for stable, citable, measurable presentation of digital scholarship, research data, and open access articles by faculty authors.

**We value what we do and the communities behind it.**

Our ten core values unite our team and push us to accomplish our work every day.

Scholarship at its best is collaborative, innovative, and engages and solves the problems of the real world. Michigan Publishing exists to support the creation and spread of knowledge and as a mission-driven organization we aim to live by the following ten values, which interconnect:

* Commitment to rich publication of scholarship
* Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEI+A)
* Durability (Preservation)
* Discoverability (Interoperability)
* Flexibility
* Reusability
* Open Ecosystems (content + infrastructure + values)

\-----------------------

Founded in 1930, it produces over 100 books a year. Core publishing fields are Political science, Performing arts, Classics and Archaeology, English Language Teaching, American studies, Michigan and the Great Lakes, and Asian studies. Press editors constantly work together to connect the Press’s strongest lists via new interdisciplinary areas. Most of our authors come from outside U-M, but the nine members of the Executive Board and a number of its series editors are U-M faculty members. UMP also has a long tradition of publishing partnerships with centers on campus, such as the Center for Japanese Studies, African Studies Center, and English Language Institute.

It has developed from the Library’s Scholarly Publishing Office, founded in 2000. MPS supports over 30 open access journals, most originally founded at U-M; by employing streamlined workflows built on library infrastructure, MPS reduces the cost of open access publishing to a level which can be supported without article-processing charges. MPS also publishes over 20 books a year, ranging from conference proceedings to grant reports, and supports digital collections such as http://www.influenzaarchive.org/ and http://www.humanitiesebook.org/.

Founded in 2006, almost all the content in Deep Blue is open access, freely available worldwide, with the exception of some embargoed content – particularly some theses and dissertations. Librarian experts work to support faculty who wish to make research data and other outputs openly available, whether through Deep Blue or the disciplinary or subject repositories most appropriate to their field, <https://www.lib.umich.edu/research-data-services>.
