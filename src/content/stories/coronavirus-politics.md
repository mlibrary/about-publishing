    "Our goal is to start to identify what matters most and to explain it in
    order to shape the

    future conversations about the meaning and lessons of this disease for comparative politics

    and health policy. The objective of the book is to identify key threads in the global

    comparative discussion that will shed light on COVID-19 and shape debates about what it

    means for scholarship in health and comparative politics."

2020 has been a sleepless year for Scott Greer and Elizabeth King, both experts in political science at the University of Michigan. Engaging with the health policy aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic has required much late night and early morning discussion with their collaborators around the world, including Elize Massard da Fonseca at the Sao Paulo School of Business Administration and Andre Peralta-Santos of the University of Washington. 

Their expertise is constantly being sought by national governments and international organizations such as the World Health Organization. However, the four long-time collaborators have also been reflecting on how to capture some of the lessons of the current crisis so that the international academic and policy community can learn from experience. Working with Elizabeth Demers, Editorial Director of the University of Michigan Press, Greer, King, Peralta, and Massard have drawn together a stellar group of case studies from around the world to develop an edited book, *Coronavirus Politics: The Comparative Politics and Policy of COVID-19.* Thanks to a novel iterative review process and an expedited production schedule, the book will be published in spring 2021. With support from the University, the electronic version will be distributed free-of-charge.
