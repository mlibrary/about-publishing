In many cases, students go to college for experiences and insights that will prepare them for their professional lives. Michigan Publishing provides a meaningful, measurable output of that experience.

Michigan Journals is home to more than 30 electronic serials, publishing peer-reviewed scholarship in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. Among these are unique student-run journals that allow students at Michigan to publish in an impactful way.  

“Working as an editor on a student-run publication gave me the opportunity to work on projects I found meaningful with like-minded people,” said Caitlin Heenan from the Undergraduate Journal of Public Health (UJPH). “We also found new outlets to share our work with others and expand the reach of our publication through a partnership with Michigan Publishing.”

Within the Michigan Journals program, student-led publications are treated like traditional academic journals, with articles uploaded in a fully searchable HTML format that Google Scholar will index, access to copy editors, professional typesetting, and printing.

This seriousness is key to the mission of the Michigan Journals program. “When you can say 40,000 people looked at your articles, that’s a lot different than just distributing copies to 50 people in your department,” said Michigan Publishing Journals Coordinator Sean Guynes.

 For many years, the University Library has supported the ambitious students in U-M’s prestigious Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) with the annual publication of the University of Michigan Undergraduate Research Journal. Funded through UROP and the Office of Research, the journal has been active for 14 years, a track record which is unusual for student-led publications to achieve. 

According to Guynes, this journals program is a way to help students beyond their Michigan Experience. “It’s about pride in research. They want the professional experience,” he said.  “They have the Michigan degree, but now they also have this experience as an editor. They want to show they’re more than just a 4.0.”
