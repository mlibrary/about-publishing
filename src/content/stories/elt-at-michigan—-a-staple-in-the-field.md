If there is an ESL course taught at an R1 institution in the United States, the odds are good that it has used a textbook from the English Language Teaching (ELT) list at the University of Michigan. For more than 60 years, University of Michigan Press’s ELT list has served as the publishing arm of the University’s English Language Institute, the first place in the United States to offer English as a Second Language courses. 

<blockquote class="quote floated blue"><p>I cannot think of any other situation in any other university where a Press and a unit have been so closely integrated for so many years. The whole idea of the ELI and \[ELT at] Michigan Press over so many years is such an incredible, pure academic success story.</p><footer><cite>- Larry Selinker<br>former ELI Director</cite></footer></blockquote>

This partnership has produced essential textbooks from some of the most well-respected authors in the field. Academic Writing for Graduate Students has been used in 85% of RI institutions in the United States and Canada. Renowned author Keith Folse has published over 30 books under the ELT imprint. In addition, the close relationship between ELT and ELI is unique.

Now in its 3rd edition, Academic Writing for Graduate Students (known globally as “Swales & Feak,” after authors John M. Swales & Christine B. Feak) has sold nearly 185,000 copies. The book embodies what a Michigan English for Academic Purposes (EAP) book is—one that teaches the skills international students need to get admitted to a university, complete a degree, and establish their voice and identity as a junior scholar in their field.

<blockquote class="quote yellow full"><p>Without these texts, many students would not publish the research that launches their academic careers, let alone finish the dissertation that gets them hired or produce the first scholarly monograph and that ultimately gets them tenure.</p><footer><cite>- Kelly Sippell<br>ELT Manager</cite></footer></blockquote>

The ELT list will continue to have an impact on L2 publishing, the field of second language writing, and graduate student development.
