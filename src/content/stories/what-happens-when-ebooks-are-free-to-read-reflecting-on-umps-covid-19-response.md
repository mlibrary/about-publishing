Between March 20 and August 31, 2020, the University of Michigan Press made all the titles in its hosted ebook collection, University of Michigan Press Ebook Collection (UMP EBC), free-to-read. This meant all titles were available for anyone to read without charge, but only users within the IP ranges of library purchasers of the collection were able to download books. This was in response to the sudden restriction of physical movement and building access due to COVID-19 pandemic “lockdowns” across the world. Because they came with little warning, these restrictions left many faculty, students, and librarians struggling to maintain continuity of research and learning. 

Even though the immediate benefit for users of free-to-read content ended in September, UMP has been eager to learn from the data  gathered in order to shape the Press' future business strategy. With this in mind, the Press did several studies of the impact of free-to-read: an IP registry analysis, [Google Analytics ](https://www.fulcrum.org/michigan/statistics?locale=en#analytics)analysis, and qualitative surveys. Additional data emerged from UMP's [readership map](https://www.fulcrum.org/michigan/statistics?locale=en), [](https://www.fulcrum.org/michigan/statistics?locale=en#analytics)Altmetrics and Dimension reports, and COUNTER reports. From these sources, 



Reactions from users indicate non-academic demand

Untapped global demand for humanities and social sciences content

85% of non-institutional use came from outside the U.S.

739 institutions/organizations used UMP EBC from 65 different countries

97% of UMP authors were supportive of the free-to-read initiative





During the period of the free-to-read initiative, we conducted several surveys with key stakeholders to get a sense of their reactions to the initiative. Respondents to our survey of authors were overwhelmingly positive with 97% supportive. Quotes from their responses fill out a picture of a group of scholars grateful for access especially on behalf of their students. While we only implemented a pop-up survey of readers on UMP EBC relatively late in the process, we received a large number of responses. What is striking from these is the geographic spread of use and the degree of interest outside the academy. Some of the responses were very moving:



> **"Without free-to-read, there is no way that an ordinary lawyer such as myself could have afforded a copy of the book and appreciated its critique of systems that I engage with on a daily basis."**



Despite the limited term of free-to-read ebooks, University of Michigan Press learned a lot from the experience. The bottom line is that if a press is able to make its books freely available in ebook form, untapped global demand for the sorts of scholarship university presses publish emerges that is entirely at odds with the popular perception that monographs “are books that do not get read.” We’ve learned this not only from statistics, but also from the feedback collected from real individual users whose gratitude for access is not only moving but inspiring — to us as a publisher and to the authors who have written their books with the expectation that they will be read but rarely get such direct feedback. UMP will continue to analyze results and use them to advocate for models that expand access.

UMP is exploring



* The majority of U-M Press sales are currently in North America, but there is clearly untapped demand for ebooks in several other countries. We have now signed a license agreement with Jisc to make UMP EBC easier to buy for libraries in the UK. We are also exploring a relationship with a sales agent for India, a growing economy where we saw a large amount of free-to-read use.
* Even when the books were free-to-use, the libraries that had purchased the ebook collection and had catalogued it were still the highest institutional users. This has led us to focus on making sure that it is easy to “turn on” UMP EBC collections in the Alma Community Zone and comparable services supplied by EBSCO and OCLC. We have particularly focused on ensuring that UMP EBC open access books are easily available to include in a library catalog even if a library can’t afford to buy the collection. The high quality of the MARC records we can provide libraries thanks to the work of the U-M Library Technical Services department makes this possible.
* The realization that much of the use was occurring in countries which could not afford full price access has led us, in the short term, to create international pricing discounted based on [World Bank classifications of country by income level](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/new-world-bank-country-classifications-income-level-2020-2021). Even with this cheaper pricing in place, the comments we received indicate that readers without institutional affiliation might still be unable to get access. In the longer term we are now exploring opportunities to expand open access availability of Press publications with an end goal of making all the specialist monographs published by the Press (at least those for which we have ebook rights) open access.
