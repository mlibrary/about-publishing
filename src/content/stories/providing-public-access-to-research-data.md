For many researchers, sharing data outside of their research team is still a relatively new practice and most have not received training. In helping researchers develop their data management and sharing practices, Michigan Publishing saw a strong need to articulate how Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility (DEI&A) values and principles could be applied. This is particularly important for research that impacts vulnerable communities as historically researchers have not considered the perspectives or needs of the communities from whom they are gathering data.

> This work will support public scholarship and allow research findings to be applied outside of academia to inform policy, practice, and public opinion

To address this situation, Michigan Publishing pursued and received a grant from the LYRASIS foundation to explore what guidance,
training, and support should be provided to researchers studying vulnerable populations in managing and sharing data sets.

This work will support public scholarship and allow research findings to be applied outside of academia to inform policy, practice, and public opinion. The primary deliverable will be a toolkit designed to promote the incorporation of open data, public scholarship, and DEI&A principles into data management and sharing practices. The toolkit will be written for a wide variety of data producers and consumers â€” from academics to  community members. Workshops will also be developed to introduce and teach the toolkit to researchers, librarians, and the public.
