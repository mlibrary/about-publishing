When Ken Fischer retired as President of University Musical Society (UMS) in 2017 after 30 years of service, he left the performing arts presenter a very different organization than he found it. UMS has always been well-regarded for bringing renowned orchestras and chamber ensembles to Ann Arbor to perform the classical music canon, but under Fischer’s leadership the organization grew, took risks, and greatly enriched its relationship with campus and local communities.

Joining UMS in 1987, Fischer said that at that time the organizations had few meaningful relationships with local arts groups and cultural organizations. “They were natural collaborators because of our obvious shared interests,” Fischer said Everybody In, Nobody Out, his memoir published in 2020 by University of Michigan Press. “I realized that since we were in the business of lifting up and celebrating cultural expressions, we needed to know much more about the cultural groups in our own backyard and what gifts they could be offering us.” Fischer also sought to build relationships with businesses, media outlets, and especially local schools in an effort to foster the next generation of performers and aficionados. Fischer’s fundraising prowess allowed UMS to commission new works, expand its range of offerings -- both musical and theatrical -- and hire additional staff.

Fischer’s legacy also extends deeply into UMS’s role within the University of Michigan campus community. While brokering partnerships with business leaders to fill Hill Auditorium, the Power Center, and Rackham Auditorium at $125 per seat, Fischer also arranged for UMS to set aside 550 tickets for students at $10 each and secured funding from Bert Askwith for the “Bert’s Tickets” program, providing each incoming student with a free UMS performance.

“I knew we’d done something right when I saw a student in khakis and a sweater sitting next to a chief executive officer in a tux on the Main Floor,” Fischer said. “One paid $10, the other $125, and they were both having a grand time.”

“In almost all colleges, Arts were for alumni and teachers, and entertainment and spectacle were for students,” said jazz musician Wynton Maralis in the Foreword to Everybody In, Nobody Out. “Here, students overflowed because Ken was out there recruiting them to the cause.” One of Fischer’s early outreach successes saw 30 Michigan music students meet with Leonard Bernstein at the home of then-U-M president James Duderstadt, a memory that continued to inspire the musicians beyond graduation.

In 2015, UMS received the National Medal of Arts for its contributions to the creative industries. Fischer accepted the award on behalf of the organization from President Obama.

The publication of Everybody In, Nobody Out -- named for Fischer’s inclusive leadership style -- itself furthers the goal of promoting the arts at Michigan. All proceeds from the book support UMS and its programs.

Publishing the autobiography of such a prominent champion of the arts continues University of Michigan Press’s tradition of engaging with creativity and creation at Michigan and beyond. Our long-running [Poets on Poetry](https://www.press.umich.edu/browse/series/UM31) series is a trusted resource on the craft of writing, while our collaboration with the Gayle Morris Sweetland Center for Writing to produce the [Sweetland Digital Rhetoric Collaborative](https://www.press.umich.edu/browse/series/UM175) series explores the innovative new methods of storytelling through emerging media.
