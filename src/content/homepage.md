    Michigan Publishing publishes scholarly and educational materials in a range
    of formats for wide distribution and permanent preservation. We support the
    broadest possible access to scholarship by promoting:

    * faculty public engagement and expert connections;

    * diversity, equity, and inclusion through the selection and distribution of
    content; and

    * academic innovation by publishing work that leverages digital technology.
