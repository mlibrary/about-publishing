    Michigan Publishing publishes scholarly and educational materials in a range
    of formats for wide distribution and permanent preservation. We support the
    broadest possible access to scholarship by promoting:


    * openness, innovation, and public engagement with the expertise of our authors and creators;

    * diversity, equity, inclusion, and a commitment to dignity in how we treat each other; and

    * continuous improvement in the structure and transparency of the processes we employ.
