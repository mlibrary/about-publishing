    Michigan Publishing publishes scholarly and educational materials in a range
    of formats for wide distribution and permanent preservation.  We support the
    broadest possible access to scholarship by promoting:


    * engagement with the expertise of authors and creators through our investments in quality, openness, and innovation;

    * equity, justice, and inclusion. We contribute to a positive work environment in which our dignity and the dignity of others are valued; and

    * improvement in the structure and clarity of the processes we employ.
