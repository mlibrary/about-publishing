description: "People's Wars in China, Malaya, and Vietnam explains why some
  insurgencies collapse after a military defeat while under other circumstances
  insurgents are able to maintain influence, rebuild strength, and ultimately
  defeat the government. The author argues that ultimate victory in civil wars
  rests on the size of the coalition of social groups established by each side
  during the conflict. When insurgents establish broad social coalitions
  (relative to the incumbent), their movement will persist even when military
  defeats lead to loss of control of territory because they enjoy the support of
  the civilian population and civilians will not defect to the incumbent. By
  contrast, when insurgents establish narrow coalitions, civilian compliance is
  solely a product of coercion. Where insurgents implement such governing
  strategies, battlefield defeats translate into political defeats and bring
  about a collapse of the insurgency because civilians defect to the incumbent.
  The empirical chapters of the book consist of six case studies of the most
  consequential insurgencies of the 20th century including that led by the
  Chinese Communist Party from 1927 to 1949, the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960),
  and the Vietnam War (1960–1975). People's Wars breaks new ground in
  systematically analyzing and comparing these three canonical cases of
  insurgency. The case studies of China and Malaya make use of Chinese-language
  archival sources, many of which have never before been used and provide an
  unprecedented level of detail into the workings of successful and unsuccessful
  insurgencies. The book adopts an interdisciplinary approach and will be of
  interest to both political scientists and historians. "
