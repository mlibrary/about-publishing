description: Housed on the campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor,
  the University Musical Society is one of the oldest performing arts presenters
  in the country. A past recipient of the National Medal of Arts, the nation’s
  highest public artistic honor, UMS connects audiences with wide-ranging
  performances in music, dance, and theater each season. Between 1987 and 2017,
  UMS was led by Ken Fischer, who over three decades pursued an ambitious
  campaign to expand and diversify the organization’s programming and
  audiences—initiatives inspired by Fischer’s overarching philosophy toward
  promoting the arts, “Everybody In, Nobody Out.”
