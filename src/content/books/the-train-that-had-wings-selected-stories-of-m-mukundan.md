description: The Train That Had Wings presents modern life in Kerala in terms of
  a shared but tragically compromised humanity. Mukundan dares to look beneath
  the routines and facades of everyday life in order to probe depth of sin,
  greed, and hypocrisy but also to rediscover what brings joy and hope.
