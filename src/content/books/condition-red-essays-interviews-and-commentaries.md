description: "Condition Red collects writing by one of America’s most gifted and
  revered poets, Yusef Komunyakaa. While themes from his earlier prose
  collection, Blue Notes, run through Condition Red, this volume expresses a
  greater sense of urgency about the human condition and the role of the artist.
  Condition Red includes his powerful letter to Poetry magazine, asserting that
  “we writers (artists) cannot forget that we are responsible for what we
  conjure and embrace through language, whether in essays, novels, plays, poems,
  or songs.” Also included are essays and interviews on: coming home to
  Bogalusa, Louisiana; the influence of religion on black poetry; language and
  eroticism; the visual artist Floyd Tunson; and the poets Robert Hayden, Walt
  Whitman, Clarence Major, and Etheridge Knight. The book features an extended
  introduction by editor Radiclani Clytus, who concludes that “Condition Red
  issues readers much more than a critical warning; it reminds us that our
  innate cultural capacity for language is, and always has been, the sum total
  of that which defines us.” The volume is part of the Poets on Poetry series. "
