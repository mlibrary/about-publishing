description: >-
  A volume in the Poets on Poetry series


  "In his deeply engaging The Sound of Listening, Philip Metres, one of the essential poets of our time, demonstrates the critical acumen that has made his poetry so attuned to our zeitgeist. Metres's essays exhibit an exhilarating range, from avant-garde installation art to pop songs, from the highbrow aesthetics of Modernism to the primal joy of memorizing poems. Generous in its listening and committed to justice and beauty and to the beauty of justice, this is a wonderfully learned and instructive book."
