  The highly esteemed literary critic and poet Sandra M. Gilbert is best known
  for her feminist literary collaborations with Susan Gubar, with whom she
  coauthored The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the
  Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination, as well as the three-volume No Man's
  Land: The Place of the Woman Writer in the Twentieth Century.


  The essays assembled in On Burning Ground display Gilbert's astonishing range and explore poetics, personal identity, feminism, and modern and contemporary literature. Among the pieces gathered here are essays on D. H. Lawrence, Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, and Louise Gl√ºck, as well as reviews and previously unpublished articles. The volume is part of the Poets on Poetry Series. 


  Sandra M. Gilbert is Distinguished Professor of English Emerita at the University of California, Davis. She is the recipient of Guggenheim, Rockefeller, NEH, and Soros Foundation fellowships and is the author of seven collections of poetry, including Kissing the Bread: New and Selected Poems 1969-1999 and, most recently, Belongings.
