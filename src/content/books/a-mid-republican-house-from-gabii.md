  Since 2009 the Gabii Project, an international archaeological initiative led
  by Nicola Terrenato and the University of Michigan, has been investigating the
  ancient Latin town of Gabii, which was both a neighbor of, and a rival to,
  Rome in the first millennium BC. The trajectory of Gabii, from an Iron Age
  settlement to a flourishing mid-Republican town to an Imperial agglomeration
  widely thought to be in decline, provides a new perspective on the dynamics of
  settlement in central Italy. This publication focuses on the construction,
  inhabitation, and repurposing of a private home at Gabii, built in the
  mid-Republican period. The remains of the house provide new information on the
  architecture and organization of domestic space in this period, adding to a
  limited corpus of well-dated examples. Importantly, the house's micro-history
  sheds light on the tensions between private and public development at Gabii as
  the town grew and reorganized itself in the mid- to late- Republican period
  transition. Published in digital form as a website backed up by a detailed
  database, the publication provides a synthesis of the excavation results
  linked to the relevant spatial, descriptive, and quantitative data.


  The Gabii Project is supported by generous grants from the University of
  Michigan, the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, the National Endowment for the
  Humanities, FIAT-Chrysler, the National Geographic Society, the Loeb Classical
  Library Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and several private
  donors.
