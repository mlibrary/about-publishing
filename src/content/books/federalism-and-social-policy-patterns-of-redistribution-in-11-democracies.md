description: "Federalism and Social Policy focuses on the crucial question: Is a
  strong and egalitarian welfare state compatible with federalism? In this
  carefully curated collection, Scott L. Greer, Heather Elliott, and the
  contributors explore the relationship between decentralization and the welfare
  state to determine whether or not decentralization has negative consequences
  for welfare. The contributors examine a variety of federal countries,
  including Spain, Canada, and the United Kingdom, asking four key questions
  related to decentralization: (1) Are there regional welfare states (such as
  Scotland, Minnesota, etc.)? (2) How much variation is there in the structures
  of federal welfare states? (3) Is federalism bad for welfare? (4) Does
  austerity recentralize or decentralize welfare states? By focusing on money
  and policy instead of law and constitutional politics, the volume shows that
  federalism shapes regional governments and policies even when decentralization
  exists."
