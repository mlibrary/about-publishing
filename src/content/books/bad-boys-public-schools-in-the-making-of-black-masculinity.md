description: "Black males are disproportionately \"in trouble\" and suspended
  from the nation's school systems. This is as true now as it was when Ann
  Arnett Ferguson's now classic Bad Boys was first published.  Bad Boys offers a
  richly textured account of daily interactions between teachers and students in
  order to demonstrate how a group of eleven- and twelve-year-old males
  construct a sense of self under adverse circumstances. This new edition
  includes a foreword by Pedro A. Noguera, and an afterword and bibliographic
  essay by the author, all of which reflect on the continuing relevance of this
  work nearly two decades after its initial publication. "
