description: Translocas focuses on drag and transgender performance and activism
  in Puerto Rico and its diaspora. Arguing for its political potential, Lawrence
  La Fountain-Stokes explores the social and cultural disruptions caused by
  Latin American and Latinx “locas” (effeminate men, drag queens, transgender
  performers, and unruly women) and the various forms of violence that queer
  individuals in Puerto Rico and the U.S. are subjected to. This
  interdisciplinary, auto-ethnographic, queer-of-color performance studies book
  explores the lives and work of contemporary performers and activists including
  Sylvia Rivera, Nina Flowers, Freddie Mercado, Javier Cardona, Jorge Merced,
  Erika López, Holly Woodlawn, Monica Beverly Hillz, Lady Catiria, and Barbra
  Herr; television programs such as RuPaul’s Drag Race; films such as Paris Is
  Burning, The Salt Mines, and Mala Mala; and literary works by authors such as
  Mayra Santos-Febres and Manuel Ramos Otero. Lawrence La Fountain-Stokes, a
  drag performer himself, demonstrates how each destabilizes (and sometimes
  reifies) dominant notions of gender and sexuality through drag and their
  embodied transgender expression. These performances provide a means to explore
  and critique issues of race, class, poverty, national identity, and migratory
  displacement; and at times posit a relationship between audiences and
  performers that has a ritual-like, communal dimension. La Fountain-Stokes also
  analyzes the murders of Jorge Steven López Mercado and Kevin Fret in Puerto
  Rico, and invites readers to challenge, question, and expand their knowledge
  about queer life, drag, trans performance, and Puerto Rican identity in the
  Caribbean and the diaspora. He also pays careful attention to transgender
  experience, highlighting how trans activists and performers mold their bodies,
  promote social change, and create community in a context that oscillates
  between glamour and abjection.
