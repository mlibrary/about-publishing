description: "Ishtyle follows queer South Asian men across borders into gay
  neighborhoods, nightclubs, bars, and house parties in Bangalore and Chicago.
  Bringing the cultural practices they are most familiar with into these spaces,
  these men accent the aesthetics of nightlife cultures through performance.
  Kareem Khubchandani develops the notion of \"ishtyle\" to name this accented
  style, while also showing how brown bodies inadvertently become accents
  themselves, ornamental inclusions in the racialized grammar of desire. Ishtyle
  allows us to reimagine a global class perpetually represented as docile and
  desexualized workers caught in the web of global capitalism. The book
  highlights a different kind of labor, the embodied work these men do to feel
  queer and sexy together. Engaging major themes in queer studies, Khubchandani
  explains how his interlocutors' performances stage relationships between:
  colonial law and public sexuality; film divas and queer fans; and race, caste,
  and desire. Ultimately, the book demonstrates that the unlikely site of
  nightlife can be a productive venue for the study of global politics and its
  institutional hierarchies."
