  Selected Prose contains a broad selection of texts by internationally
  acclaimed poet and critic John Ashbery. This third collection of Ashbery's
  critical writings dramatically expands the terrain covered by the first two,
  Reported Sightings: Art Chronicles 1957-1987 and Other Traditions (first
  presented as the Norton Lectures at Harvard in 1989-90). These essays on
  writers, artists, filmmakers, and the life of a poet provide insight into
  Ashbery's evolution as one of the major poets in English. Ashbery's unique
  sensibility has had a profound impact on the literature and arts of our time,
  and his influence is certain to be felt for decades to come. Editor Eugene
  Richie's introduction explores the poetic and cultural context of fifty years'
  worth of prose by one of America's finest poets. The volume is part of the
  Poets on Poetry Series. 


  John Ashbery is the author of twenty books of poetry and is the recipient of three lifetime achievement awards. He is Charles P. Stevenson, Jr. Professor of Languages and Literature at Bard College. Eugene Richie (ed.) is Director of Writing at Pace University, where he also teaches writing and literature.
