  ESC is a work of experimental audio-based scholarship combining sound studies,
  radio history, and environmental criticism. This unique project is a fully
  open access, fully digital suite of audiographic essays, presented as a
  ten-part podcast series, combining spoken commentary, clips from classic radio
  dramas, excerpts from films and television shows, news reports, and the work
  of contemporary sound artists. A brief written essay on the ESC website
  provides a helpful introduction and context for this project.


  Jacob Smith is Professor in the Department of Radio/Television/Film and
  Director of the Master of Arts Program in Sound Arts and Industries at
  Northwestern University.
