  Coming After gathers critical pieces by acclaimed poet Alice Notley, author of
  Mysteries of Small Houses and Disobedience.


  Notley explores the work of second-generation New York School poets and their allies: Ted Berrigan, Anne Waldman, Joanne Kyger, Ron Padgett, Lorenzo Thomas, and others. These essays and reviews are among the first to deal with a generation of poets notorious for their refusal to criticize and theorize, assuming the stance that "only the poems matter." The essays are characterized by Notley's strong, compelling voice, which transfixes the reader even in the midst of professional detail. Coming After revives the possibility of the readable book of criticism. The volume is part of the Poets on Poetry Series.

She has been an important presence in the second-generation New York School, and for the past decade has lived in Paris. She is the winner of the Los Angeles Times Book Award for Poetry. She received an Academy Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the Poetry Society of America's Shelly Memorial Award. Notley has been an important presence in the second generation New York School. She is the author of over 20 books and for the past decade has lived in Paris.
