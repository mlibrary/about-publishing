description: "This volume features new work on cinema in early twentieth-century
  Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Republican China. Looking beyond relatively
  well-studied cities like Shanghai, these essays foreground cinema's
  relationship with imperialism and colonialism and emphasize the rapid
  development of cinema as a sociocultural institution. These essays examine
  where films were screened; how cinema-going as a social activity adapted from
  and integrated with existing social norms and practices; the extent to which
  Cantonese opera and other regional performance traditions were models for the
  development of cinematic conventions; the role foreign films played in the
  development of cinema as an industry in the Republican era; and much more. "
