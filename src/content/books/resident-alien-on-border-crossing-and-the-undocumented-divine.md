description: "Kazim Ali uses a range of subjects—the politics of checkpoints at
  international borders; difficulties in translation; collaborations between
  poets and choreographers; and connections between poetry and landscape, or
  between biotechnology and the human body—to situate the individual human body
  into a larger global context, with all of its political and social
  implications. He finds in the quality of ecstatic utterance his passport to
  regions where reason and logic fail and the only knowledge is instinctual, in
  physical existence and breath. This collection includes Ali’s essays on topics
  such as Anne Carson’s translations of Euripides; the poetry and politics of
  Mahmoud Darwish; Josey Foo’s poetry/dance collaborations with choreographer
  Leah Stein; Olga Broumas’ collaboration with T. Begley; Jorie Graham’s
  complication of Kenneth Goldsmith’s theories; the postmodern spirituality of
  the 14th century Kashmiri mystic poet Lalla; translations of Homer,
  Mandelstam, Sappho, and Hafez; as well as the poet Reetika Vazirani’s practice
  of yoga. This volume is part of the Poets on Poetry Series. "
