description: >-
  Donald Hall believes that American poetry, at the present moment, thrives both
  in quality and in leadership. In his 1995 collection of essays, reviews, and
  interviews, Hall counters the increasingly publicized view that poetry has an
  ever-diminishing importance in contemporary American culture. He resents the
  endlessly repeated clich√© that finds poetry unpopular and losing popularity.
  Thus: Death to the Death of Poetry.


  Throughout the pages of his fourth and final offering in the Poets on Poetry series, Hall returns again and again to the theme of poetry's health, and offers essays praising contemporary poets, who serve as examples of poetry's thriving condition. In addition, Death to the Death of Poetry collects interviews in which Hall discusses the work of poetry--revisions, standards, the psychology and sociology of the poet's life.


  Donald Hall holds degrees from Harvard and Oxford and was a recipient of the Lamont Poetry Selection Award, poetry editor for the Paris Review, editor of the Poets on Poetry series, and a Professor of English at the University of Michigan, before returning to his ancestral home in New Hampshire.
