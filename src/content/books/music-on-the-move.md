description: >-
  Music is a mobile art. When people move to faraway places, whether by choice
  or by force, they bring their music along. Music creates a meaningful point of
  contact for individuals and for groups; it can encourage curiosity and foster
  understanding; and it can preserve a sense of identity and comfort in an
  unfamiliar or hostile environment. As music crosses cultural, linguistic, and
  political boundaries, it continually changes. While human mobility and
  mediation have always shaped music-making, our current era of digital
  connectedness introduces new creative opportunities and inspiration even as it
  extends concerns about issues such as copyright infringement and cultural
  appropriation.
   
  With its innovative multimodal approach, Music on the Move invites readers to listen and engage with many different types of music as they read. The text introduces a variety of concepts related to music’s travels—with or without its makers—including colonialism, migration, diaspora, mediation, propaganda, copyright, and hybridity. The case studies represent a variety of musical genres and styles, Western and non-Western, concert music, traditional music, and popular music. Highly accessible, jargon-free, and media-rich, Music on the Move is suitable for students as well as general-interest readers.
