  The Passionate Spectator collects essays, reviews, and art criticism by John
  Yau, an internationally lauded poet, critic, and curator. In this wide-ranging
  collection, which is part of the Poets on Poetry series, Yau explores the
  intersection of art and poetry, dissolving boundaries between the artistic
  traditions and reimagining what it means to see and to write. Whether he is
  interpreting the poetic use of titles in Jessica Stockholder's paintings,
  reviewing the collaborative book project between American poet Robert Creeley
  and German artist Georg Baselitz, or considering the significance of Frank
  O'Hara's decision to have his portrait drawn wearing nothing but army boots,
  Yau is consistently daring, original, and contemporary.


  Yau's diverse critical sensibilities permeate The Passionate Spectator as he moves seamlessly between the visual and literary arts. Highlights of this collection include an essay on the poet as art critic, a study of the relationship between Kevin Young's poetry and the paintings of Jean-Michel Basquiat, and an imaginative piece in which Yau speculates about what Jorge Luis Borges would have created had he been a visual artist. In the title essay, Yau lays out the duty of the spectator---a duty shared by viewer, reader, critic, and artist: "it is up to us to experience art, to engage and believe in its power."


  John Yau is the author of many books of poetry, fiction, and criticism, including Borrowed Love Poems and The United States of Jasper Johns. His most recent collection is Paradiso Diaspora. Yau's collaborations with artists have been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Pompidou Center in Paris among many other venues. In 2002, France named Yau a Chevalier in the Order of Arts and Letters. He is on the faculty of Mason Gross School of the Arts, Rutgers University.
