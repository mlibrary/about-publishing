description: "Digital media histories are part of a global network, and South
  Asia is a key nexus in shaping the trajectory of digital media in the
  twenty-first century. Digital platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, and others
  are deeply embedded in the daily lives of millions of people around the world,
  shaping how people engage with others as kin, as citizens, and as consumers.
  Moving away from Anglo-American and strictly national frameworks, the essays
  in this book explore the intersections of local, national, regional, and
  global forces that shape contemporary digital culture(s) in regions like South
  Asia: the rise of digital and mobile media technologies, the ongoing
  transformation of established media industries, and emergent forms of digital
  media practice and use that are reconfiguring sociocultural, political, and
  economic terrains across the Indian subcontinent. From massive state-driven
  digital identity projects and YouTube censorship to Tinder and dating culture,
  from Twitter and primetime television to Facebook and political rumors, Global
  Digital Cultures focuses on enduring concerns of representation, identity, and
  power while grappling with algorithmic curation and data-driven processes of
  production, circulation, and consumption."
