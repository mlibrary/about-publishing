description: Academic Ableism brings together disability studies and
  institutional critique to recognize the ways that disability is composed in
  and by higher education, and rewrites the spaces, times, and economies of
  disability in higher education to place disability front and center. For too
  long, argues Jay Timothy Dolmage, disability has been constructed as the
  antithesis of higher education, often positioned as a distraction, a drain, a
  problem to be solved. The ethic of higher education encourages students and
  teachers alike to accentuate ability, valorize perfection, and stigmatize
  anything that hints at intellectual, mental, or physical weakness, even as we
  gesture toward the value of diversity and innovation. Examining everything
  from campus accommodation processes, to architecture, to popular films about
  college life, Dolmage argues that disability is central to higher education,
  and that building more inclusive schools allows better education for all.
