  With the recently-published The Woman Who Fell from the Sky, Joy Harjo has
  emerged as one of the most powerful Native American voices of her generation.
  Over the past two decades, Harjo has refined and perfected a unique poetic
  voice that speaks her multifaceted experience as Native American, woman and
  Westerner in twentieth-century society.


  The Spiral of Memory gathers the conversations in which Harjo has articulated her singular yet universal perspective on the world and her poetry. She reflects upon the nuances and development of her art, the importance of her origins, the arduous reconstruction of the tribal past, the dramatic confrontation between Native American and Anglo civilizations, the existential and artistic itinerary through present-day America, and other provocative and profoundly human themes. The volume is part of the Poets on Poetry series. 


  Joy Harjo is the author of several volumes of poetry. She received awards from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Before Columbus Foundation, and the Poetry Society of America. She is Professor of English, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque. Laura Coltelli (ed.) is Associate Professor of American Literature, University of Pisa.
