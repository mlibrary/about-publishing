description: COVID-19 is the most significant global crisis of any of our
  lifetimes. The numbers have been stupefying, whether of infection and
  mortality, the scale of public health measures, or the economic consequences
  of shutdown. Coronavirus Politics identifies key threads in the global
  comparative discussion that continue to shed light on COVID-19 and shape
  debates about what it means for scholarship in health and comparative
  politics. Editors Scott L. Greer, Elizabeth J. King, Elize Massard da Fonseca,
  and André Peralta-Santos bring together over 30 authors versed in politics and
  the health issues in order to understand the health policy decisions, the
  public health interventions, the social policy decisions, their interactions,
  and the reasons. The book’s coverage is global, with a wide range of key and
  exemplary countries, and contains a mixture of comparative, thematic, and
  templated country studies. All go beyond reporting and monitoring to develop
  explanations that draw on the authors' expertise while engaging in structured
  conversations across the book.
